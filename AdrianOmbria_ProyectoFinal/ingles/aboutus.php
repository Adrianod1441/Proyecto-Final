                <p style="margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px">Oblectatio is a newly store created whose function is the sale of toys for everyone.
                    Our goal is that all children have a toy or as we would say "a friend" which
                    serves to get a smile and in the most difficult moments serve as emotional support.

                <p style="margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px">The word Oblectatio comes from the old Latin oblectatios which translated into Spanish
                    means fun or entertainment. Our company philosophy goes hand in hand with the terminology of our own
                    name of our store.</p>
